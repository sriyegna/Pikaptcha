# Pikaptcha
**I am currently in the process of moving so development is going to be very slow for the next few days. A GUI is almost in place that will account for most of the user input errors. **

Based off pikapy by skvvv, which is based off ptc2 Kitryn, which is based off ptcaccount by jepayne1138, etc.
Also uses pogoapi from keyphact

Was updated with several features/fixes on Aug 23 2016. To update open CMD or terminal
^^Update also broke (email verification) which is now fixed as of Aug 23 2016 5:30AM EST. Update again please.
`pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/sriyegna/pikaptcha`

## Description
Pikaptcha creates PTC accounts by creating a chrome session and automatically entering data in the required fields. If you choose to use the 2captcha service, the entire script can be run automatically, else you will need to manually solve captchas.
Pikaptcha creates the PTC account and completes the TOS in game. It does verify emails.

## Installation
**For Windows**
Install the following clickable links: (if you cannot click them, all links are at the bottom.)

1. If you intend to manually solve captcha, you need [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed to default directory in C:\Program Files\

2. [Python 2.7.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/). Do this during setup. http://imgur.com/k421LiP

3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Do this during setup. http://imgur.com/rhQi73O

4. [Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=44266)

5. Shift+Right Click your desktop and "Open command window here".

6. Type `path` and hit enter. You should see C:\Python27, C:\Python27\Scripts, and C:\Program Files\Git\cmd

7. If you intend to manually solve captcha, [Download Chromedriver](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.23/chromedriver_win32.zip). Unzip the file and place it in C:\Python27\Scripts

## Using 2captcha
If you want to use the 2captcha service (if you cannot click the links, they are also at the bottom of the readme)

1. You need to download [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)

2. You need to open the .zip file, open the phantomjs-2.x.x-windows folder, open the bin folder, and put phantomjs.exe in C:\Python27\Scripts

3. [You need to sign up here](https://2captcha.com/auth/register)

4. [Verify your email (if needed) and login](https://2captcha.com/auth/login)

5. Either work (Start Work on top) or deposit money (Deposit on left). Get a balance or you will have no credit to solve captchas

6. Click the "2Captcha API" tab at the top

7. Look for captcha KEY. There should be a long string after that like a6ebcb3f4a7b6f6e319d8e1c37e25ec4

8. For the rest of the guide %YOUR_2CAPTCHA_KEY%=the string you found there

## Using Auto-Email Verify
If you want to automatically verify emails, there are some specific instructions you need to follow. To help you understand plusmail, I wrote this snippet.

**To verify all emails while running, refer to Example 8 & 9. You also need to allow less secure apps to connect to your google account because of the python imap library. https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en**
~ Thoridal

Also, to verify emails, you should have a relatively empty inbox. Else it needs to index your whole Inbox folder everytime and that isn't very fun.

The PlusMail trick work as follows. Suppose your name is Mark and you own Mark@gmail.com as your email account. If I send an email to Mark+Jacob@gmail.com, it will still go to Mark@gmail.com. Similarly, if I send an email to Mark+asldksdjek@gmail.com, it will go to Mark@gmail.com. The PlusMail trick takes advantage of the fact that Niantic doesn't check that there isn't a difference between Mark and Mark+Jacob because not all email providers support this. When you use "-m mark@gmail", it will generate emails like Mark+asdkjs@gmail.com differently for each account creation, but all emails will go to Mark@gmail.com. To use the plusmail trick, refer to any example with the argument -m

## How to use
Shift+Right Click your desktop and "Open command window here". OR open Terminal if on linux/osx. Note that usernames.txt (the file with the accounts) will be made on your desktop, or wherever you ran terminal/cmd from. To run pikaptcha, just type `pikaptcha` into the cmd/terminal. Do not run from C:\ unless you read Example 10. See examples below.

You can type `pikaptcha --help` to see all parameters. Optional parameters are as follows.
```
	--username, -u #This is the username
	--password, -p #This is the password
	--email, -e #This is the email
	--plusmail, -m #Suppose your gmail address is test@gmail.com. If you use -m test@gmail.com, this will activate the plusmail trick
	--count, -c #This is the number of accounts to make
	--recaptcha, -r #This is your 2captcha key
	--autoverify, -av #Set this to True if you want to autoverify emails. Otherwise False (or don't use the tag)
	--googlepass, -gp #This is the password to your google account if you are using -m argument and -av True
	--location, -l #This is the location that is spoofed when accepting TOS
	--textfile, -t #This is the location of the output text file. Eg: -t C:\users\sri\desktop\user.txt
	--outputformat, -of #If you pass pkgo, it will print in the PokemonGo-Map format (-u user -p pass).
	--startnum, -sn #If you use -c and -u, it will start counting from this number instead
	--captchatimeout, -ct #If you want captcha to timeout of after n seconds	
	--inputtext, -it #If you want to read user:pass from file
	--proxy, -px #Proxy to be used when accepting the Terms of Services. Must be host:port (ex. 1.1.1.1:80). Must be a HTTPS proxy.
```

Example 1 : Create an entirely random account by manually entering the captcha yourself

```
pikaptcha
```

Example 2 : Create an entirely random account with automated captcha solving

```
pikaptcha -r %YOUR_2CAPTCHA_KEY%"
When you enter your 2captcha key, it will look something like
pikaptcha -r a6ebcb3f4a7b6f6e319d8e1c37e25ec4"
```
	
Example 3 : Create 10 entirely random accounts by manually entering the captcha yourself

```
pikaptcha -c 10
```
	
Example 4 : Create 10 an entirely random accounts with automated captcha solving	

```
pikaptcha -c 10 -r %YOUR_2CAPTCHA_KEY%
When you enter your 2captcha key, it will look something like
pikaptcha -c 10 -r a6ebcb3f4a7b6f6e319d8e1c37e25ec4
```

Example 5 : Create 10 random accounts that have the same set password=PaSsWoRd by manually entering captcha

```
pikaptcha -c 10 -p PaSsWoRd
```

Example 6 : Create 1 account that has a specific username=UsErNaMe with automated captcha solving

```
pikaptcha -u UsErNaMe -r %YOUR_2CAPTCHA_KEY%
```

Example 7 : Create 10 accounts using a single email address (read below on plusmail for more info) with automated captcha solving

```
pikaptcha -p PaSsWoRd -c 10 -m emailaddress@gmail.com -r %YOUR_2CAPTCHA_KEY%
```

Example 8 : Create 5 accounts using the plusmail trick with email verification and manual captcha solving

```
pikaptcha -c 5 -m emailaddress@gmail.com -av True -gp GoOgLePaSs
```

Example 9 : Create 5 accounts using the plusmail trick with email verification and automated captcha solving

```
pikaptcha -c 5 -m emailaddress@gmail.com -r %YOUR_2CAPTCHA_KEY% -av True -gp GoOgLePaSs
```
	
Example 10 : Specify the location you mock when you sign TOS

```
pikaptcha -l 40.7127837,-74.005941
Make sure there are no spaces in between the numbers, and make sure that there is only 1 comma in between both numbers
```

Example 11 : Specify the location to save the username:password. By default, it will save in the directory you run cmd/terminal from

```
pikaptcha -t "C:\Users\YoUr_UsEr\Desktop\usernames.txt"
You need to run cmd as admin if you want to save in C:\
```

Example 12 : Make the output file formatted for PokemonGo-Map.

```
pikaptcha -of pkgo
will output -u user1 -p pass1 -u user2 -p pass2 -u user3 -p pass3
```

Example 13 : Creating multiple accounts with the same username + 1, 2, 3, ...
```
pikaptcha -u user -c 10
this will create user1, user2, ..., user 10
```

Example 14 : Creating multiple accounts with the same username + a number that increments by 1 starting at 15
```
pikaptcha -u user -c 10 -sn 15
this will create user15, user16, ..., user 24
```

Example 15 : If it takes longer than 40 seconds to solve captcha, cancel the request and forfeit $0.003
```
pikaptcha -ct 40 -r %YOUR_2CAPTCHA_KEY%
```

Example 16 : Read user:pass from a file. It should be formatted like so
```
mark:pass1
jacob:pass2
james:passn
```
```
pikaptcha -it C:\user\sri\desktop\inputaccs.txt
```

Example 17 : Use public proxy when accepting the Terms of Services.
```
pikaptcha -px https://1.1.1.1:1
```

Example 18 : Use private proxy with authentication when accepting the Terms of Services.
```
pikaptcha -px https://user:password@1.1.1.1:1
```
